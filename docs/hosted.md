title: Hosted PopIt
---

Using the hosted version of PopIt is the simplest way to start creating reusable lists of politicians and other public figures.

## Create an instance

The first thing to do is to [create a PopIt instance](http://popit.mysociety.org/instances/new). Each distinct set of data should have it's own instance. So, for example, you might want to create an instance for the UK Parliament, or one for your local council. The form has two fields, one for how the instance name will appear in the url, and one for your email address.

Once you've filled in the form and submitted it you'll be sent a confirmation email. You'll need to follow the link in the email to finish creating your new instance.

## Populate your instance

Now you've created a PopIt instance you'll probably want to start populating it with some data. For more details see [using PopIt]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/using-popit/).

## Accessing data over the API

If you want to access your data programatically then take a look at [using the API]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/api/).
